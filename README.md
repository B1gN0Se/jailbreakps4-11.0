# jailbreakps4-11.0

Tested on **Kali Linux**

### Description:
A shell script program to run on your VM using Linux and perform the PS4 jailbreak  

### Steps:

Connect the ethernet cable between your computer and ps4

Create a new PPPoE connection on your ps4, setting everything to automatic and not using any proxy.

**DON'T TEST THE INTERNET CONNECTION YET**

Open your VM (Linux) and download this repo.

Shutdown your VM and change the network settings to ethernet. (We didn't do this previously because your VM wouldn't have an internet connection to download the repository.)

Start your VM again

Run these commands

```sh
chmod +x run.sh
```

```sh
./run.sh
```

Click on "Test connection" immediately after running the command above. Just wait and note your PS4 being jailbroken after a few seconds/minutes.
